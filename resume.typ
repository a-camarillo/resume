Servo Motor Driver - 
https://github.com.com/a-camarillo/embedded-rust/tree/main/esp32c6-test/servo-motor

Technologies: ESP32C6, SG90 Servo Motor, Rust, esp-hal

Utilized Rust to write a custom module for the ESP32C6 microcontroller,
allowing the microcontroller to communicate with and operate and SG90
servo motor.

Leveraged existing ESP library for configuring onboard timers and generating
pulse-width modulation signals to control motor position.
